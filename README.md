# Custom Pomodoro Timer with Music Selection

## Description
This project is a web application which allows the user to set a pomodoro timer with a specificed study time, break time, and cycles. Additionally, the application includes a selection of atmospheric music which often accompanies studying/working. Currently the music options are lofi, synthwave, and rain noise; adding additional 
options by editing the html and javascript is mostly trivial. However, if you use this project and would like me to add another option, submit an issue on this repository and I'll be sure to get it added! Utilizing this application is very simple, just set your desired study time, break time, cycles, and music then hit start. Music 
volume can be adjusted with the volume slider.
